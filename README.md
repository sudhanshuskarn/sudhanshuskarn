## Project 2: **Image Augmentation Tool**
![install-page](/image/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-25%2000-02-08.png)
**Description:**
Developed a powerful Image Augmentation Tool designed to enhance and preprocess images for machine learning applications. The tool applies a variety of transformations, including rotation, flipping, scaling, cropping, and color adjustments, to increase the diversity of training datasets. By leveraging these techniques, the tool helps improve the generalization ability of models, making them more robust to variations in input data. This project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, computer vision, and deep learning model optimization.

## Project 3: **Image Processor Library**
![usage-prompt](/images/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-21%2017-47-32.png)
**Description:**
ImageProcessor is a C++ library for Linux that provides a set of powerful image filtering and enhancement operations using OpenCV. It allows users to perform a variety of common image processing tasks, such as blurring, contrast enhancement, brightness/contrast adjustments, and gamma correction. With this library, you can easily integrate advanced image manipulation functions into your own applications with minimal setup.
